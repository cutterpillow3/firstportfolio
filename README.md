# Maureen's Portfolio

Hi everyone,

I created a single webpage for CMSC 207 Midterm requirement. The webpage contains 3 sections: About Me, Hobbies and Contact. I applied different techniques. I also apply a 'FunFactButton' with changing of color when hovered and showing/hiding the fun fact when button is clicked. Lastly, this single webpage is friendly to different screen sizes. 

There are lots of references used for my First Portfolio. One helpful reference worth mentioning is when I encountered a challenge wherein the images are not appearing in the github website. I searched for a resolution and this particular reference helped me: https://support.exclaimer.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4445816657309-How-to-host-images-using-Google-Drive. I go with the route of hosting the image through Google Drive instead of uploading an image folder in my repository since the image is not showing. If ever you have suggestion on the hover-image resolution, contact me. 

I hope this page will give a brief introduction about me and in the future, you can also introduce yourself to me. It's my pleasure working on the first portfolio and there will be more to come.

Regards,

Maureen
